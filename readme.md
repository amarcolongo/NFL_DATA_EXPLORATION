# Analysis of NFL QB rating
## by Anthony Marcolongo


## Dataset

> I used the NFL QB career stats dataset for this project. I imported the csv files into a pandas dataframe. I then dropped unneeded colums. I removed spaces from the column names. I dropped rows with zero values. I then removed all rows with fewer then 100 career completions to focus in on QB's with longer careers.I then graphed each variable in my dataset against QB rating to see which variable had the strongest correlation. I then revomed rows that were not correlated, or where weakly correlated. I then looked at the effects of 2 variables at a time. I graphed several bivariate graphs and looked more closely at the results. Finally I produced a multivariate heatmap to see how all the variables in my dataset where connected. 


## Summary of Findings

> When I started this analysis I was interested in determining which factors, if any, were predictive of QB success as measured by QB rating. What I found was that there is a clear and undeniable link between passing yards per attempt and QB rating and also completion percentage and QB rating. This was not what I had expected to find and actually a very interesting result. Passing yards per attempt being an important factor implies that you should throw the ball down the field to maximizes that stats. Completion percentage though implies the opposite, usually QB's will be more accurate on shorter passes. If you were starting an NFL team today you should try and find a QB that is willing to throw deep, but can also be accurate as well. Your risk of interception increases slightly by throwing deep but your overall efficency increases dramatically. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> My main finding was that contrary to conventional football wisdom, throwing deep passes actually does not increase your likely hood of throwing interceptions more than marginally, but it greatly increases your likely hood for success. To really increase your odds for success though you need a QB that can throw deep but also can be accurate.
